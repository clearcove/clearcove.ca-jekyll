As software developers, we do our work during &#8220;Maker Time&#8221; or &#8220;Flow&#8221;. This time regularly gets interrupted for reasons like:

  * we have to wait for a deploy/install/compile step to finish
  * we run into a problem we don&#8217;t know how to solve
  * we received an IM or an email
  * we are low on energy and can&#8217;t concentrate any more

The cost of these interruptions is not only the time it takes to get back into flow, but the risk of following a distraction vector and moving away from the task at hand. What is a distraction vector? Here are some examples:

  * reading Hacker News/reddit/&#8230;
  * checking Twitter or Facebook or [insert your favorite social network here]
  * &#8230; [fill in your favorite waste of time here]

I noticed that I have developed these as automatic responses to interruptions of maker time and often I don&#8217;t even notice that this is happening.

The best way to get rid of this automated response is to replace it with a beneficial habit. I am working on developing these two habits:

### Be intentional about my information consumption

I use http://intigi.com to get the news that are relevant to my work. This helps eliminating irrelevant distraction vectors. I recommend you find out more about managing your information diet.

### Do physical exerciselets

The benefits of exercise are so obvious, and still, I am under the impression that a lot of people struggle with doing regular exercise (me included). I try to exercise regularly using these short exerciselets, that each fit easily into a single maker time interruption:

  * 10 [squats][1], duration: 30 seconds
  * 10 [pushups][2], duration: 30 seconds
  * 10 [back extensions with exercise ball][3], duration: 30 seconds
  * Yoga, e.g., [sun salutation][4], duration: 2-3 minutes

By doing one of these exerciselets whenever I have a natural break, my cognitive ability is noticeably enhanced afterwards. Not to mention the health benefits of regular exercise.

What exerciselets do you recommend for natural programmers&#8217; breaks? I do these in my private office. Would you feel comfortable doing this in a shared office?
