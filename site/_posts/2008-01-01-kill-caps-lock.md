I found myself too many times having to rewrite the last word because I hit the caps lock key by accident. I decided to take care of this annoyance once and for all

Here is how to turn off the caps lock key on OS X Leopard:

  1. Go to &#8220;System Preferences&#8221;
  2. Select &#8220;Keyboard & Mouse&#8221;
  3. Go to the &#8220;Keyboard tab&#8221; and click &#8220;Modifier Keys â€¦&#8221;
  4. Select &#8220;No Action&#8221; for the Caps Lock Key

Now you will never be annoyed again by accidental uppercase characters. What a useless key &#8230;
