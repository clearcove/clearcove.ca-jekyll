Having switched to marketing mode, I did some research into using story telling for marketing. Here are a bunch of resources:

  * An introductory article that illustrates the concept:Â [A Crash Course in Marketing With Stories | Copyblogger][1].
  * How to apply storytelling to marketing: [The Importance of Storytelling in Marketing][2].
  * About using stories in speeches, also applies to marketing: [How to tell powerful stories in your speeches][3].
  * Seth Godin on this topic: [Ode: How to tell a great story][4].
  * 5 story archetypes: [5 Story Archetypes To Become More Impactful][5].
  * 7 basic plots: [The Seven Basic Plots][6].
  * 8 archetypal stories: [Archetypal Stories][7].
  * 9 story lines from Beyond Buzz: [The Nine Best Story Lines for Marketing][8].
  * [The 22 rules of storytelling, according to Pixar][9]
