A very rubyish approach to debugging. Offers

  * A &#8211; assert
  * B &#8211; beep
  * C &#8211; callstack
  * D &#8211; debugger
  * D1/D2 &#8211; object diff
  * E &#8211; empty check
  * F &#8211; write to file
  * J &#8211; jump into object
  * L &#8211; logger
  * M &#8211; mark as tainted, untainted
  * N &#8211; nil check
  * P &#8211; print to STDOUT
  * R &#8211; ri Ruby documentation
  * S &#8211; bump safety level
  * T &#8211; timestamp

  And it prints in Awesome Print format.
