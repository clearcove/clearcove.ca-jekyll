Abstract:

&nbsp;

The relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak, which may stem in part from the way people spend it. Drawing on&nbsp;empirical research, we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money. Specifically, we suggest that&nbsp;consumers should

  1. buy more experiences and fewer material goods;
  2. use their money to benefit others rather than themselves;
  3. buy many&nbsp;small pleasures rather than fewer large ones;
  4. eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance;
  5. delay consumption;
  6. consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day-to-day lives;
  7. beware of comparison shopping; and
  8. pay close&nbsp;attention to the happiness of others.
