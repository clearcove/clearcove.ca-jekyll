A set of best practices for software-as-a-service apps.

> The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:
> 
>   * Use&nbsp;declarative&nbsp;formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
>   * Have a&nbsp;clean contract&nbsp;with the underlying operating system, offering&nbsp;maximum portability&nbsp;between execution environments;
>   * Are suitable for&nbsp;deployment&nbsp;on modern&nbsp;cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
>   * Minimize divergence&nbsp;between development and production, enabling&nbsp;continuous deployment&nbsp;for maximum agility;
>   * And can&nbsp;scale up&nbsp;without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
