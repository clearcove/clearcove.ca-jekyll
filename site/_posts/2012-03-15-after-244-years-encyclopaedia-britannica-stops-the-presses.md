Another sign of the changes that are currently happening:

> After 244 years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica is going out of print.
> 
> Those coolly authoritative, gold-lettered reference books that were once sold door-to-door by a fleet of traveling salesmen and displayed as proud fixtures in American homes will be discontinued, company executives said.
> 
> In an acknowledgment of the realities of the digital age &mdash; and of competition from the Web site Wikipedia &mdash; Encyclopaedia Britannica will focus primarily on its online encyclopedias and educational curriculum for schools. The last print version is the 32-volume 2010 edition, which weighs 129 pounds and includes new entries on global warming and the Human Genome Project.
> 
> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rite of passage in this new era,&rdquo; Jorge Cauz, the president of Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc., a company based in Chicago, said in an interview. &ldquo;Some people will feel sad about it and nostalgic about it. But we have a better tool now. The Web site is continuously updated, it&rsquo;s much more expansive and it has multimedia.&rdquo;
