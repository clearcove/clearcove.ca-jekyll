I needed to access a US only website from Canada, so I set up a VPN from my OS X home machine to my Ubuntu server at DigitalOcean. It took me all of 15 minutes to follow these two tutorials:

  1. [<span style="line-height: 13px;">Set up PPTP on the Ubuntu server</span>][1]
  2. [Set up a VPN on OS X][2]

Worked flawlessly.
