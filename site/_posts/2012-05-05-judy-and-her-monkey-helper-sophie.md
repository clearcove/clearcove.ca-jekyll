Very touching story of a symbiosis I had never heard of:

> Judy met George while on a sailing trip in the Caribbean. They fell in love, married, and began an active life in Vermont. From the moment Judy discovered she had progressive multiple sclerosis, life for the couple began to change in ways they could have never predicted. By the summer of 2011, Judy had long lost her ability to walk and most of the motion in her upper body. George had become a full time caregiver. This is the story of how Sophie, a capuchin monkey, came to change both of their lives.
