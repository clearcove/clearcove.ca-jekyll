Mark Burnett disects the TSA&#8217;s password policy and recommends this one instead:

> So what would I use as the ultimate password policy? If I was ever in the position to set an organization&rsquo;s policy, and it required a much higher than normal security, it would be this:
> 
>   * Minimum password length is 15 characters but can contain anything you want including spaces.
>   * Your new password shouldn&rsquo;t look too much like your last one.
>   * Don&rsquo;t reuse this same password anywhere else.
> 
> Then, I would provide a short list of example passwords to spark their creativity such as this:
> 
>   * www.craving-tacos.mx
>   * whitefish44.JPG
>   * C:program filesgreen
>   * 1-800-orange piano
