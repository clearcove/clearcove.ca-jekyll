When you&#8217;re stumped as to how to begin a piece of writing, consider doing one of the following:

  * Simply tell the reader what the subject is.
  * Make a blunt statement.
  * Cite a statistic.
  * Tell a first-person anecdote that&#8217;s relevant to the subject.
  * Tell a third-person anecdote.
  * Put up a straw man, then knock it down.
  * Summarize a current state of affairs (or the conventional wisdom), then tell what&#8217;s changed.
  * Summarize previous research, then tell what new research has found.
  * Involve the reader in a bit of conjecture.
  * Start with a quotation from a famous figure. (But beware of triteness.)
  * Commit an egregious exaggeration. Then explain what the (less extreme) reality is.
