Fascinating 17 minute video about how bicycles were made in 1945. Makes one appreciate all the work that went into manufacturing one!

> The process of manufacture is traced from the beginning; the design on paper and the raw materials. We see what goes to make the steel tubes of the frames, the handle bars, the gear wheels, the pedal cranks, the pedals, the spokes, the wheels and the hubs, until at last the complete bicycle is ready for testing.
