Martin Fowler weighs in on the test coverage debate, saying that the coverage percentage is a vanity metric. He would rather apply these criteria:

> I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:
> 
>   * You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
>   * You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
