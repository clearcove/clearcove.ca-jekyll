Avdi Grimm about refactoring, referring to fairly small changes to code, taking only a few minutes each:

  * We must be hypersensitive to pain.
  * We must have comprehensive, reliable, fast automated tests.
  * We must have a license to refactor.
  * We must have good tools.

He also talks about a similar concept called &#8220;Refurbishing&#8221; which is at a larger scale, between a complete rewrite and refactorings.

Interesting to see our vocabulary for these things become more nuanced.
