      <p class="unconstrained">
        I started professional software development in 1998 and founded ClearCove Software Inc. in 2006. Outside of work I enjoy outdoor pursuits (hiking, trail running and open water rowing) and gardening. I live with my family on the unceded traditional territory of the K’ómoks First Nation on Vancouver Island, Canada.
