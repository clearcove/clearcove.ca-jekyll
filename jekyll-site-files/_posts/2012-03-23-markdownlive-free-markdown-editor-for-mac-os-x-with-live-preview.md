This markdown editor/previewer is the best one so far for my purposes:

  * has editing and preview in a split view: see content in realtime
  * handles technical text (lots of code snippets)
  * has the following extensions (via [discount][1]): 
      * [Smartipants][2] substitutions
      * specify image sizes
      * definition lists
      * alpha lists
      * tables like [PHP Markdown-Extra][3]
  * it&#8217;s free
