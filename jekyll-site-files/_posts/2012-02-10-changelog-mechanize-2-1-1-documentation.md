I contributed to the excellent Mechanize gem in version 2.1.1:

> Mechanize no longer follows meta refreshes that have no &#8220;url=&#8221; in the content attribute to avoid infinite loops. To follow a meta refresh to the same page set Mechanize#follow\_meta\_refresh_self to true. Issue #134 by Jo Hund.
