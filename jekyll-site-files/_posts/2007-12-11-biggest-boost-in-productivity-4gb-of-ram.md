The biggest boost in productivity I have experienced since adding a second display has been putting too much RAM into my computers. I think what makes the difference is that I never have to wait for the computer. Just the way it should be with a good tool.

Switching programs, searching for text in files, viewing thousands of photos â€” everything is instantly. And the cost is almost negligible: $25USD per GB of RAM at [Other World Computing][1].
