A framework for describing/analyzing procrastination, using 4 variables:

  * Value: Does the task have low value because it&#8217;s boring or painful or too difficult, or because the reward isn&#8217;t that great?
  * Expectancy: Do I doubt that completing the task will pay off?
  * Delay: Would I have to wait a long time for my reward if I succeeded?
  * Impulsiveness: Am I particularly impatient or impulsive, either now or in general?

I&#8217;m interested in this mostly for its potential to help me identify areas in my life/work that are less than optimal. I would notice that procrastination is happening, in a next step I could apply the above checklist to find out why exactly I&#8217;m not getting stuff done. Then I could address the issue causing the procrastination and in the process further improve my life.

Other factors for procrastination could also be tiredness, lack of exercise or insufficient nutrition.
