A detailed article about caching in Rails3:

> Caching in Rails is covered occasionally. It is covered in very basic detail in the caching guide. Advanced caching is left to reader. Here&rsquo;s where I come in.

Covers:

  * Page Caching: not applicable to most real world apps
  * Action Caching: a bit more useful than Page Caching, runs before_filters
  * Fragment Caching: Store parts of views
  * Rails.cache: Store anything at this level
