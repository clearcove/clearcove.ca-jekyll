The video shows how the Afghan box camera is used. It&#8217;s camera, dark room and photo studio all in one:

> The Afghan Box Camera Project provides a record of the kamra-e-faoree (instant camera) which as a living form of photography is on the brink of disappearing in Afghanistan.
> 
> In this video, Qalam Nabi, one of the last two remaining box camera photographers in Kabul demonstrates how to use his camera.
