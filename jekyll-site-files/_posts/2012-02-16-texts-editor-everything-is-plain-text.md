The longer I work with information and computers, the more I appreciate plain text format: No compatibility issues, tool doesn&#8217;t get in the way, versioning via git, and documents can be shared without friction.

Texts Editor is a very nice editor with visual style display that outputs plain markdown formatted text.

Combine this with a tool like [Pandoc][1] (universal document converter), and you have a very powerful document pipeline.
