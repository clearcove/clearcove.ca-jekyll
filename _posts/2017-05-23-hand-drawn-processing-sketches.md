[Handy](https://www.gicentre.net/software/#/handy/) allows you to produce graphics with a hand-drawn appearance in [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketches. This can be customised to produce a variety of styles including pencil, watercolour and ink and marker pen appearance.

Alternatively you can use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [scribble](https://github.com/generative-light/p5.scribble.js).

Below are some example images produced with Handy:
