      * Communication
      * Simplicity
      * Flexibility
  * Key learnings 
      * You ain&#8217;t gonna need it
      * Write high level tests to guide the development
      * Best practices for [Unit] testing
      * Focus!
  * Misc 
      * Parallel design (gradually replace an old design with a new one)
      * Resumable refactoring
      * Refactor on green, at will
      * Symmetry in the code: &#8220;Symmetry in code is where the same idea is expressed the same way everywhere it appears in the code.&#8221;
