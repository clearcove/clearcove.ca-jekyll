Here is a collection of articles that I found helpful when it comes to technical writing:

## [What to write](https://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/)

Jacob Kaplan-Moss writes about three kinds of technical writing: 

> Tech docs can take a bunch of different forms ranging from high-level overviews, to step-by-step walkthroughs, to auto-generated API documentation. Unfortunately, no single format works for all users; there’s huge differences in the way that people learn, so a well-documented project needs to provide many different forms of documentation.
>
> At a high level, you can break down the different types of documentation you need to provide into three different formats:
> * step-by-step tutorials,
> * overviews and topical guides to the various conceptual areas of your project, and
> * low-level, deep-dive reference material.


## [Technical style](https://jacobian.org/writing/technical-style/)

Jacob Kaplan-Moss writes about how to develop a writing style that produces great technical documentation.



## [You need an editor](https://jacobian.org/writing/editors/)

After writing about what and how, Jacob Kaplan-Moss writes about the need to edit your writing. Ideally it's someone else, however he also has tips for self-editing.

Two nuggets: 

* Give it time - put some time between the tasks of writing and editing.
* Shake things up - in order to get out of a rut, change the page margins so that the text flows differently and doesn't look as familiar.

## [How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Eric S. Raymond and Rick Moen's gold standard for asking questions in technical forums:

> In the world of hackers, the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. This guide will teach you how to ask questions in a way more likely to get you a satisfactory answer.

Outline:

    * Don't rush to claim that you have found a bug
    * Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework
