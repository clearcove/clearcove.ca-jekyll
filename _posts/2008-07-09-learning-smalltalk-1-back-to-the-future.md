I am learning Smalltalk and will document my progress in a series of blog posts. I have heard too many interesting things about it to ignore it any longer. I am hoping to use it for web development and while learning it, to become a better programmer in [other languages][1] as well.

I tried to remember what the stepping stones have been so far:

  * At RailsConf 2007, [Avi Bryant][2] talked about [Smalltalk][3] and [Seaside][4].
  * While listening to a computer science lecture, I heard quotes from [Alan Kay][5], one of the Smalltalk inventors. What he said over 20 years ago is still relevant today. That is rare in the world of computers.
  * At RailsConf 2008, Avi Bryant demonstrated [Maglev][6] — Ruby running on the Gemstone/S Smalltalk VM. This is the future world with no relational databases. Just magic distributed object persistence.
  * When learning more about Extreme Programming, I found out that XP was invented in the Smalltalk community.
  * I keep hearing that learning Smalltalk will stretch your mind and make you a better programmer.

So there are a number of reasons to get familiar with Smalltalk. Enough reasons for me to get started:

  1. I installed [Squeak][7] on my Mac since it is open source and Seaside uses it.
  2. I read the article &#8220;[Design Principles Behind Smalltalk][8]&#8221; to better understand ST&#8217;s philosophy and underlying concepts. It was written in 1981 by Dan Ingalls, one of the inventors of Smalltalk. Back to the future baby!
  3. I am reading a free e-book titled &#8220;[Squeak by Example][9]&#8220;. It is a great introduction into the Smalltalk language and the Squeak environment.
  4. Now that I can read Smalltalk code, I will start digging around in the Seaside source code.

All right, I have to go back to my Smalltalk book now …
