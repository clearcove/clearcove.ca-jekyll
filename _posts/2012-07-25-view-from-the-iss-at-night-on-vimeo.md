An amazing video of the view from the International Space Station down to earth:

> Every frame in this video is a photograph taken from the International Space Station. All credit goes to the crews on board the ISS.  
> I removed noise and edited some shots in photoshop. Compiled and arranged in Sony Vegas.

What struck me:

  * how small a planet we live on.
  * how thin the atmosphere is.
  * how amazing a thunderstorm looks from above.
  * how much &#8220;light pollution&#8221; there is on our planet.
