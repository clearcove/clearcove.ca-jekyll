  This screencast shows how to use Redhat&#8217;s Torquebox and Immutant projects to run JRuby and clojure apps in the same process, seamlessly integrating them through AS7&#8242;s messaging and cache (Infinispan).

<p class="iii-article-excerpt">

<p class="iii-article-excerpt">
  Super awesomeness!
