  &#8220;If anyone is remote, you&#8217;re all remote.&#8221; At Atomic Object, we value co-located teams. But not every team member can always be co-located. Larger project teams may have members from multiple offices. Some projects might involve working closely with other vendors. I experience this &#8220;remoteness&#8221;&#8230;

  <span class="comment"><span style="color: #000000;">Based on my 10+ years experience of working remotely, I agree 100% with this article. My observation has been that distributed teams work well when the majority of the team is remote. It makes written communication inevitable. However when I was the only remote person in a team of 4 or more people, I felt left out. Conference calls with everybody else on one side and me on the other were quite frustrating. I missed out on the informal watercooler talk and conversations in the team office. I never felt that remote work works well in an asymmetric situation.</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand, I think every team benefits from clear written communications. Having a remote team enforces this best practice where having a co-located team lets communication practices slip and become sloppy.</span>
