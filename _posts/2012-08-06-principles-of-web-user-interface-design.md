A list of (web) user interface design principles. They are all on a conceptual level, so good for high-level/big-picture work.

Some examples:

  * Clarity is job #1
  * Interfaces exist to enable interaction
  * Conserve attention at all costs
  * &#8230;
  * Smart organization reduces cognitive load
  * Highlight, don&#8217;t determine, with color
  * &#8230;
  * Existing problems are most valuable

A commenter on [Hacker News][1]&nbsp;added these even more general rules:

>   1. Respect your users
>   2. Respect their time
>   3. Respect that they are different from you
> 
> If you find yourself thinking &#8220;now I have to change it so stupid people can use it&#8221; then you will never make a UI worth a damn.
