> In this article, I&#8217;ll provide a functional introduction to four important concepts and tools for sculpting text: regex, grep, sed and awk.

  * regex is a language for describing patterns in strings;&nbsp;
  * grep filters its input against a pattern;
  * sed applies transformation rules to each line; and
  * awk manipulates an ad hoc database stored as text, e.g. CSV files.
