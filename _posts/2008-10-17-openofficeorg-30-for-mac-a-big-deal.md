it&#8217;s been officially released for a few days now and I think it is a big deal. OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a big step forward:

    Native Aqua &#8211; means it looks as beautiful as we expect from an OS X app. That has a big impact on my productivity. I enjoy working with beautiful tools. It also means that I don&#8217;t need X11. Less hassle and faster startup
  </li>
  <li>
    PDF import &#8211; wow, I can now edit PDFs. Very useful when I receive contracts as PDF and have to return them signed: Open contract, insert signature image, save PDF, email back. Sleek. And no need to spend a dollar on PDF editing tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Better compatibility with MS Office formats
  </li>
</ul>
