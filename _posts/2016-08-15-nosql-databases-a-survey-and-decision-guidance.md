A thorough [survey of NoSQL databases](https://medium.com/baqend-blog/nosql-databases-a-survey-and-decision-guidance-ea7823a822d#.9k1hawql2):

> Today, data is generated and consumed at unprecedented scale. This has lead to novel approaches for scalable data management subsumed under the term “NoSQL” database systems to handle the ever-increasing data volume and request loads. However, the heterogeneity and diversity of the numerous existing systems impede the well-informed selection of a data store appropriate for a given application context. Therefore, this article gives a top-down overview of the field: Instead of contrasting the implementation specifics of individual representatives, we propose a comparative classification model that relates functional and non-functional requirements to techniques and algorithms employed in NoSQL databases. This NoSQL Toolbox allows us to derive a simple decision tree to help practitioners and researchers filter potential system candidates based on central application requirements.
