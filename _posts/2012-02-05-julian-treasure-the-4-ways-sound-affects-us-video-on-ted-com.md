In this 5 minutes video, Julian Treasure demonstrates in a compelling way how sound affects us in these 4 ways:

  * physiological
  * psychological
  * cognitive
  * behavioral

He claims that productivity in an open-plan work environment is reduced by as much as 66%. In other words, you are 1/3 as productive as you would be in a quiet environment.

He also demonstrates how listening to the sounds of waves and chirping birds helps us relax.

I find this connection of science and what is often considered &#8220;touchy feely fluffy stuff&#8221; very compelling. Turns out that both approaches have theirÂ merits.
