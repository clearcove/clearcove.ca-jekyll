A great exercise to improve OO style coding:

  1. Use only one level of indentation per method.
  2. Don&rsquo;t use the &lsquo;else&rsquo; keyword.
  3. Wrap all primitives and strings.
  4. Use only one dot per line.
  5. Don&rsquo;t abbreviate names.
  6. Keep entities small.
  7. Don&rsquo;t use any classes with more than two instance variables.
  8. Use first-class collections.
  9. Don&rsquo;t use setters, getters, or properties.
