The website [betterexplained.com](http://betterexplained.com) uses the ADEPT method to explain concepts in a very effective way:

* Analogy: Tell me what it’s like so that I can anchor it within my current understanding.
* Diagram: Help me visualize it to engage that part of the brain.
* Example: Allow me to experience it (show don’t tell).
* Plain English: Describe it with everyday words.
* Technical definition: Discuss the formal details.
