<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Great article about Software Engineering by the creator of the Storm processor:</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">He talks about how production use exposes our software to unexpected input spaces and helps us harden the software (building up its immune system). There is no shortcut for this.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">He lists the types of uncertainties we&#8217;re dealing with in software engineering:</span>

  * uncertainty about your specs
  * uncertainty about your implementation
  * uncertainty about your dependencies
  * uncertainty about your inputs
