Rich Hickey talks about simple vs. easy:

  * simple: not entangled with another braid. This is desirable.
  * complect: to entangle with something else. The verb that leads to complexity.
  * easy: nearby, accessible, doesn&#8217;t require much work on the programmer&#8217;s side. This is not desirable.
  * Example for entanglement/complexity: connascence by sequence as seen in positional method arguments (vs. keyword arguments), syntax (vs. data structures), method chaining (vs. queueing).
