Jay Fields recommends the following commands for working with log files, etc.:

  * cat: concatenate files and print on standard output
  * sort: sort lines of text files, e.g., cat order.* | sort
  * grep: filter lines matching a pattern
  * cut: remove sections from each line
  * sed: perform basic text transforms
  * uniq: remove duplicate lines from a file
  * find: search for files in a directory hierarchy: find /Users -name &#8220;order.*&#8221;
  * less: move forward and backward within a file. Forward: /, backward: ?, <Shift> + f tails the file.
