title: Make Better Decisions Based on More Accurate Information
author: jhund
excerpt: |
  Your information should reflect your business as closely as possible. If it doesn't, things can get really messy:
  
  <ul>
    <li>information gets out of synch through various document revisions floating around in the email universe and on various users' hard drives</li>
    <li>information might be out of date because a collaborator used an old document version</li>
    <li>the data is not modelled accurately after your business reality</li>
  </ul>
