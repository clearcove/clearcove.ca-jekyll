Good overview over the state of the news industry.

> All the jokes from newspaper production departments or ad sales reps about how news articles are &ldquo;to keep the ads from bumping into each other&rdquo; have more than just a grain of truth to them.

Summary/excerpts:

  * &#8220;a digital newspaper becomes just another online information source among thousands of others, and that kind of competition isn&rsquo;t something most publishers are used to dealing with.&#8221;
  * &#8220;the foundation of most newspaper business models &mdash; that is, the monopoly over information delivery &mdash; was doomed as soon as the internet came along, with its virtually frictionless distribution model and non-existent barriers to access.&#8221;
  * &#8220;The monopoly was on the delivery of printed advertising messages into homes in a given city or (better) metropolitan area: department store ads, supermarket ads, car dealer ads, and, most of all, classifieds. Notice that I didn&rsquo;t mention news. That&rsquo;s because, once a monopoly was established, the editorial content of a newspaper had no detectable impact on its financial success.&#8221;
  * Newspapers&#8217; monopoly on news distribution is eroding quickly, and&nbsp;advertisers now have an almost unlimited field in which to play.
  * &#8220;newspapers are being forced to confront the fact that the financial model that supported their news and journalism is crumbling. And simply cutting costs [...] without investing anything on the digital side is a recipe for disaster.&#8221;
  * &#8220;how does a former monopoly survive in a market &mdash; for both news and advertising &mdash; that has become almost hyper-competitive?&#8221;
