<h1>Quentin Time Tracker</h1>
<p>Quentin is the tool I wrote to track how I spend my time. This is important for invoicing my clients and to measure how and where I spend my time &mdash; which I consider my scarcest resource.</p>
<p>Being a contract software developer, tracking my time is extremely important for my business: I need to write invoices with task break downs, I want to get better at estimating, and I am just curious about what I spend my time on.</p>
<p>So I filled this real need by writing my own Rails time tracker: meet Quentin. I cleaned it up a bit and just published it as an MIT-licensed <a href="http://github.com/jhund/quentin">open source project on github</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Track time</strong> in real time &mdash; with a start and stop button.</li>
<li>Easily <strong>make changes</strong> &mdash; because sometimes I forget to start/stop the timer and then I need to be able to manually change times. There is an audit trail, so all changes are recorded.</li>
<li>Render <strong>reports</strong> that help me understand quality as well as quantity of my time &mdash; hours worked per week, number of interruptions per hour, roles I fulfilled.</li>
<li>Generate <strong>invoices</strong> &mdash; render line items and track which hours have been invoiced.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tracking time</h2>
<p>The screenshot below shows the Quentin dashboard where I spend most of my time. It shows a list of the most recently tracked activities. There is also a form to add new activities, and some summary information.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_146" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Quentin dashboard"]<a href="http://clearcove.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/quentin-dashboard1.jpg"><img src="assets/quentin-dashboard1-300x124.jpg" alt="Quentin dashboard" title="quentin-dashboard" width="300" height="124" class="size-medium wp-image-146" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>The activities are grouped by days. Quentin shows the total hours for each day next to the date. The currently tracked activity is highlighted in green. At any point you can add a new activity and start the timer on it.</p>
<h2>Invoicing</h2>
<p>I can generate invoices in Quentin with a list of all activities that haven't been billed yet for a given project. The screenshot below shows a screenshot of the invoice detail view.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>When you track your activities every day, over the course of a year, you have a very rich pool of data to work with. With reporting, I can know how much time I spend ...</p>
<ul>
<li>on a given project - so that I can invoice my clients</li>
<li>fulfilling a certain role - so that I can plan and measure my professional development</li>
<li>per week working - so that I can work towards a sustainable work load</li>
</ul>
<p>The other things I can learn from the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>How am I doing for revenue this year?</li>
<li>Which projects are falling behind and need attention?</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are a number of reporting screenshots:</p>
