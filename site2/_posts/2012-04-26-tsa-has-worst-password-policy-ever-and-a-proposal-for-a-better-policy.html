<p>Mark Burnett disects the TSA's password policy and recommends this one instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what would I use as the ultimate password policy? If I was ever in the position to set an organization&rsquo;s policy, and it required a much higher than normal security, it would be this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum password length is 15 characters but can contain anything you want including spaces.</li>
<li>Your new password shouldn&rsquo;t look too much like your last one.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t reuse this same password anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I would provide a short list of example passwords to spark their creativity such as this:</p>
<ul>
<li>www.craving-tacos.mx</li>
<li>whitefish44.JPG</li>
<li>C:program filesgreen</li>
<li>1-800-orange piano</li>
</ul>
