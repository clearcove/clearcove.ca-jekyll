<p>Description of how to use HMAC for secure API access. Gist:</p>
<ul>
<li>send the message payload, along with a cryptographic hash of the payload</li>
<li>client and server both know a private key which is part of the hash</li>
<li>server can compute hash itself to confirm authenticity of payload.</li>
</ul>
