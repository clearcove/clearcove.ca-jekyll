<p>The article examines different types of coupling and what they look like in Rails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coupling refers to the degree to which components in your program rely on each other. You should generally seek to minimize this property, though you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s impossible to eliminate entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pathological coupling: one class reaches into another and changes instance variables.</li>
<li>Global coupling: Two classes that rely on some global state.</li>
<li>Control coupling: a parameter is passed to a method that determines the control flows in the method.</li>
<li>Data coupling: a parameter is passed to a method that does not impact the control flow in the method.</li>
<li>Message coupling: Jim Weirich calls this "Connascence by Name". The least costly type of all couplings. This is the one we should strive for.</li>
</ul>
