<p>A list of (web) user interface design principles. They are all on a conceptual level, so good for high-level/big-picture work.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity is job #1</li>
<li>Interfaces exist to enable interaction</li>
<li>Conserve attention at all costs</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Smart organization reduces cognitive load</li>
<li>Highlight, don't determine, with color</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Existing problems are most valuable</li>
</ul>
<p>A commenter on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4341939">Hacker News</a>&nbsp;added these even more general rules:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Respect your users</li>
<li>Respect their time</li>
<li>Respect that they are different from you</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself thinking "now I have to change it so stupid people can use it" then you will never make a UI worth a damn.</p>
