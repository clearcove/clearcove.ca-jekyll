<p>A proposal for reflection at the end of the day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every day, before leaving the office, save a few minutes to think about what just happened. Look at your calendar and compare what actually happened &mdash; the meetings you attended, the work you got done, the conversations you had, the people with whom you interacted, even the breaks you took &mdash; with your plan for what you wanted to have happen. Then ask yourself three sets of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did the day go? What success did I experience? What challenges did I endure?</li>
<li>What did I learn today? About myself? About others? What do I plan to do &mdash; differently or the same &mdash; tomorrow?</li>
<li>Who did I interact with? Anyone I need to update? Thank? Ask a question? Share feedback?</li>
</ul>
