<p>Yesterday <a href="http://protocool.com">Trevor</a> mentioned the <a href="http://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle/tree/master">Ack TextMate bundle</a> he developed to provide better "Search in project". I installed it and was instantly sold:</p>
<ul>
<li>search is much faster using <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack</a></li>
<li>the results list pops up instantly with the first hits, and then it just keeps growing as you start reviewing the results
</li>
<li>it has an option to show context around the results (see screenshot below)</li>
<li>you can customize the search behavior on a per user or per project basis using a <a href="http://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle/wikis/recognizing-files">.ackrc file</a></li>
<li>it has an option to follow symlinks. Useful for me because I symlink rails into vendor for my apps. Normally I don't want to include the rails source in my project search</li>
<li>search is limited to currently selected file/folder and its children. Useful for scoping searches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trevor also provides a <a href="http://protocool.com/demos/ack_tmbundle.mov">screencast</a> that highlights features and usage.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle.git Ack.tmbundle</pre>
<p><strong>Custom .ackrc file</strong></p>
<p>By default ack does not search all file types related to Rails projects. So I added some extensions using the ~/.ackrc file:</p>
<pre>
--type-add=ruby=.haml,.rake,.rsel
</pre>
<p>You have to tell ack to consider the .ackrc file: In the search dialog, open advanced options and check the corresponding check box.</p>
<p>Thanks Trevor!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2008-08-24</strong>: Updated the screenshot with the 'default' Textmate theme which looks a lot nicer.<br />
<strong>Update 2008-11-08</strong>: Added example .ackrc file</p>
