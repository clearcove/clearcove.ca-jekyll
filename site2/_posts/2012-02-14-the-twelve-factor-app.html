<p>A set of best practices for software-as-a-service apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use&nbsp;declarative&nbsp;formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;</li>
<li>Have a&nbsp;clean contract&nbsp;with the underlying operating system, offering&nbsp;maximum portability&nbsp;between execution environments;</li>
<li>Are suitable for&nbsp;deployment&nbsp;on modern&nbsp;cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;</li>
<li>Minimize divergence&nbsp;between development and production, enabling&nbsp;continuous deployment&nbsp;for maximum agility;</li>
<li>And can&nbsp;scale up&nbsp;without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.</li>
</ul>
