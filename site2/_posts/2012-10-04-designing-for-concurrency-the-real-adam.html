<blockquote>
<p>A lot is made about how difficult it is to write multi-threaded programs. No doubt, it is harder than writing a CRUD application or your own testing library. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s not as difficult as writing a database or 3D graphics engine. The point is, it&rsquo;s worth learning how to do. Skipping the hubris and knowing your program will have bugs that require discipline to track down is an enabling step to learning to write multithreaded programs.</p>
