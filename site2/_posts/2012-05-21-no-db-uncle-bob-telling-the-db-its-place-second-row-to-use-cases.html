<blockquote>
<p>If you get the database involved early, then it will warp your design. It&rsquo;ll fight to gain control of the center, and once there it will hold onto the center like a scruffy terrier. You have to work hard to keep the database out of the center of your systems. You have to continuously say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the temptation to get the database working early.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are heading into an interesting time. A time when the prohibition against different data storage mechanisms has been lifted, and we are free to experiment with many novel new approaches. But as we play with our CouchDBs and our Mongos and BigTables, remember this: The database is just a detail that you don&rsquo;t need to figure out right away.</p>
