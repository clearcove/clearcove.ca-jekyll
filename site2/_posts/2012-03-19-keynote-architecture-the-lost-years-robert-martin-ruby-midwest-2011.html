<p>Bob Martin at 43:30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's what architecture is: Find some place to draw a line, and then make sure every dependency that crosses that line goes in the same direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reminds us of an architectural pattern that was presented in the early nineties by Ivar Jacobson:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boundary interfaces: Interfaces that define how a control object interacts with an actor.</li>
<li>Entity objects: They are business specific, however not app specific. E.g., an Order, a Document, a Product. They don't care about persistence. Just the data structures and business rules.</li>
<li>Control objects: Also referred to as Interactors, one for each Use Case. They are business and app specific. They integrate Actors, Entities other control objects, and supporting components.</li>
</ul>
