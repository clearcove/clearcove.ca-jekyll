<p>Great article about usage of AR callbacks. Boils it down to this rule:</p>
<blockquote class="iii-article-quote">
<p>Use a callback only when the logic refers to state internal to the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise you will feel the pain of bad coupling when testing and continuing to work with your app.</p>
