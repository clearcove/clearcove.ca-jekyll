<p>My development environment is OS X. In order to do cross-browser testing with Internet Explorer (IE) on MS Window, I use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"><span style="line-height: 13px;">Oracle VirtualBox</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">ievms</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Start ievms virtual boxes right away!</h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 13px;">When installing ievms, I had to launch the images right away. In one case I just installed them and let them sit for more than 30 days. In this scenario I could not restore them to the 30 day trial window.</span></p>
<h4>Set up network</h4>
<p>When testing, I want to connect to the local web server running on my OS X host system. In order to do so, there needs to be network connectivity between the Windows guest and the OS X host. I found it worked best when I choose 'Bridged Adapter' and then access the web server on the OS X host via its local network IP address.</p>
<p>Choose the networking mode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Virtual box image</li>
<li>Select 'Settings'</li>
<li>Select 'Network' tab</li>
<li>Check 'Enable Network Adapter'</li>
<li>Select Attached to: 'Bridged Adapter'</li>
<li>Select the right device (the one that connects to your router so that it can assign an IP address to your Windows guest machine)</li>
<li>Click 'Ok'</li>
<li>Now start your windows guest machine</li>
<li>You can review IP addresses: Windows: Start / Command prompt / "ipconfig /all"; OS X: in console type "ifconfig -a"; Both systems should share the same subnet in order to connect.</li>
<li>Ping your host: "ping 192.168.1.111"</li>
<li>To connect to your local web server on the OS X host: Start Internet Explorer, type the following into your address bar: "http://192.168.1.111:3000" (adjust the IP address and server port as needed).<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: I found that it did not work unless I prefixed the address with 'http://'. I also had to wait quite a bit after boot, and I also pinged the host. Eventually it always worked. Not sure which of these three made it happen...</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we go, 2 more Yaks shaved.</p>
