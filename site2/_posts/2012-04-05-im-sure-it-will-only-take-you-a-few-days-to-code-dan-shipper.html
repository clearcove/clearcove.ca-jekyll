<p>Dan Shipper's thoughts on why estimating software projects is hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So the site&rsquo;s pretty simple, all it needs to do is X, Y and Z. You seem like a good programmer so I&rsquo;m sure it will only take you a few days to put it together.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary: The two heuristics humans use to estimate complexity don't work for software:</p>
<ul>
<li>speed</li>
<li>size</li>
</ul>
