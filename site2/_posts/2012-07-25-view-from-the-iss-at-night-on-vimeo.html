<p>An amazing video of the view from the International Space Station down to earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every frame in this video is a photograph taken from the International Space Station. All credit goes to the crews on board the ISS.<br />I removed noise and edited some shots in photoshop. Compiled and arranged in Sony Vegas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What struck me:</p>
<ul>
<li>how small a planet we live on.</li>
<li>how thin the atmosphere is.</li>
<li>how amazing a thunderstorm looks from above.</li>
<li>how much "light pollution" there is on our planet.</li>
</ul>
