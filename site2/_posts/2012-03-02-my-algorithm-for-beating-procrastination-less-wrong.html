<p>A framework for describing/analyzing procrastination, using 4 variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value: Does the task have low value because it's boring or painful or too difficult, or because the reward isn't that great?</li>
<li>Expectancy: Do I doubt that completing the task will pay off?</li>
<li>Delay: Would I have to wait a long time for my reward if I succeeded?</li>
<li>Impulsiveness: Am I particularly impatient or impulsive, either now or in general?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm interested in this mostly for its potential to help me identify areas in my life/work that are less than optimal. I would notice that procrastination is happening, in a next step I could apply the above checklist to find out why exactly I'm not getting stuff done. Then I could address the issue causing the procrastination and in the process further improve my life.</p>
<p>Other factors for procrastination could also be tiredness, lack of exercise or insufficient nutrition.</p>
