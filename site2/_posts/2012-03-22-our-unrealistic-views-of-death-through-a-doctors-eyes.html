<p>Being aware of death can help getting our priorities right. Here is a doctor's take on the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I head to the ER. If I&rsquo;m lucky, the family will accept the news that, in a time when we can separate conjoined twins and reattach severed limbs, people still wear out and die of old age. If I&rsquo;m lucky, the family will recognize that their loved one&rsquo;s life is nearing its end.</p>
