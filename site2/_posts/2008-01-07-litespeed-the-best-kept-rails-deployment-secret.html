<p>There is a great way to deploy rails applications. I know it is being used on some high traffic production deployments. How come it never gets mentioned in any official Rails documentation?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.litespeedtech.com/">Litespeed</a> is its name. It is free â€” not open source though. And that may be the reason why you don't hear much about it in the Rails community.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Why I like it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Super simple deployment. No mongrels, monit, or apache. Litespeed replaces all three of them: It has the front end, load balancer, and manages its own Ruby processes.</li>
<li>Nice GUI for system management: server configuration, control, and updates are all handled through a super simple and sleek UI.</li>
<li>It is free to use for most small to medium scale web apps. You pay for the "Enterprise" version.</li>
<li>Small memory footprint. Gives you more apps per MB of RAM on your server. That translates directly into saved hosting dollars and makes for snappier apps.</li>
</ol>
