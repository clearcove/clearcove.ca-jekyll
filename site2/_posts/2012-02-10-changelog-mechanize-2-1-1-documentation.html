<p>I contributed to the excellent Mechanize gem in version 2.1.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mechanize no longer follows meta refreshes that have no "url=" in the content attribute to avoid infinite loops. To follow a meta refresh to the same page set Mechanize#follow_meta_refresh_self to true. Issue #134 by Jo Hund.</p>
</blockquote>
