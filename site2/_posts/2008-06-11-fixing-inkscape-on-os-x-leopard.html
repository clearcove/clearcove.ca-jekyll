<p>After I upgraded to Leopard, Inkscape did not start up any more. Just a blank screen. Here is what I did to fix it:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you like <a title="Inkscape" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outbound/www.inkscape.org/');" href="http://www.inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (an open source alternative to Adobe Illustrator) and have a Mac with Leopard; you will figure that it after installation it will not work. It will say that font caching might take time, but never start. Itâ€™s because of a simple bug, with a simple solution. Just open a terminal (Applications/Utilities) and type this, followed by an enter;</p>
<p><code>mkdir ~/.fontconfig</code><br />
After that it should start normally.</p></blockquote>
