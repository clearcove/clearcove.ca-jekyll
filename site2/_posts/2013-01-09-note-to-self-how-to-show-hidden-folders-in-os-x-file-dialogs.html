<p>I was trying to specify a custom SSH key to connect to a remote database via SSH tunnel with my database client. The standard OS X file dialog doesn't show hidden folders, so I couldn't select the custom key file in the ~/.ssh folder.</p>
<p>Turns out it's quite simple. Press the following keys to toggle visibility of hidden folders in OS X file dialogs:</p>
<pre>&lt;command&gt; + &lt;shift&gt; + '.'</pre>
<p>That last character is a period.</p>
