<p>As software developers, we do our work during "Maker Time" or "Flow". This time regularly gets interrupted for reasons like:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have to wait for a deploy/install/compile step to finish</li>
<li>we run into a problem we don't know how to solve</li>
<li>we received an IM or an email</li>
<li>we are low on energy and can't concentrate any more</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of these interruptions is not only the time it takes to get back into flow, but the risk of following a distraction vector and moving away from the task at hand. What is a distraction vector? Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading Hacker News/reddit/...</li>
<li>checking Twitter or Facebook or [insert your favorite social network here]</li>
<li>... [fill in your favorite waste of time here]</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that I have developed these as automatic responses to interruptions of maker time and often I don't even notice that this is happening.</p>
<p>The best way to get rid of this automated response is to replace it with a beneficial habit. I am working on developing these two habits:</p>
<h3>Be intentional about my information consumption</h3>
<p>I use http://intigi.com to get the news that are relevant to my work. This helps eliminating irrelevant distraction vectors. I recommend you find out more about managing your information diet.</p>
<h3>Do physical exerciselets</h3>
<p>The benefits of exercise are so obvious, and still, I am under the impression that a lot of people struggle with doing regular exercise (me included). I try to exercise regularly using these short exerciselets, that each fit easily into a single maker time interruption:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 <a href="http://www.builtlean.com/2010/07/20/how-to-do-proper-squat-technique/">squats</a>, duration: 30 seconds</li>
<li>10 <a href="http://www.builtlean.com/2011/02/23/how-to-proper-push-up-form/">pushups</a>, duration: 30 seconds</li>
<li>10 <a href="http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/exercises.asp?exercise=17">back extensions with exercise ball</a>, duration: 30 seconds</li>
<li>Yoga, e.g., <a href="http://www.abc-of-yoga.com/yogapractice/sunsalutation.asp">sun salutation</a>, duration: 2-3 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing one of these exerciselets whenever I have a natural break, my cognitive ability is noticeably enhanced afterwards. Not to mention the health benefits of regular exercise.</p>
<p>What exerciselets do you recommend for natural programmers' breaks? I do these in my private office. Would you feel comfortable doing this in a shared office?</p>
