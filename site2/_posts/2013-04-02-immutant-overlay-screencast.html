<p class="iii-article-excerpt">This screencast shows how to use Redhat's Torquebox and Immutant projects to run JRuby and clojure apps in the same process, seamlessly integrating them through AS7's messaging and cache (Infinispan).</p>
<p class="iii-article-excerpt">This is a very potent mix for building multi-faceted software: JRuby and Rails for the front-end and all the background processing in highly concurrent clojure.</p>
<p class="iii-article-excerpt">Super awesomeness!</p>
