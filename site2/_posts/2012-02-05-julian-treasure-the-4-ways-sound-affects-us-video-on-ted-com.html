<blockquote>Playing sound effects both pleasant and awful, Julian Treasure shows how sound affects us in four significant ways. Listen carefully for a shocking fact about noisy open-plan offices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Link: <a href="http://bit.ly/y3tdoe">Julian Treasure: The 4 ways sound affects us | Video on TED.com</a></p>
<p>In this 5 minutes video, Julian Treasure demonstrates in a compelling way how sound affects us in these 4 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>physiological</li>
<li>psychological</li>
<li>cognitive</li>
<li>behavioral</li>
</ul>
<p>He claims that productivity in an open-plan work environment is reduced by as much as 66%. In other words, you are 1/3 as productive as you would be in a quiet environment.</p>
<p>He also demonstrates how listening to the sounds of waves and chirping birds helps us relax.</p>
<p>I find this connection of science and what is often considered "touchy feely fluffy stuff" very compelling. Turns out that both approaches have theirÂ merits.</p>
