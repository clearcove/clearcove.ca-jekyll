<p>I am learning Smalltalk and will document my progress in a series of blog posts. I have heard too many interesting things about it to ignore it any longer. I am hoping to use it for web development and while learning it, to become a better programmer in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">other languages</a> as well.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I tried to remember what the stepping stones have been so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>At RailsConf 2007, <a href="http://www.avibryant.com/">Avi Bryant</a> talked about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> and <a href="http://www.seaside.st/">Seaside</a>.</li>
<li>While listening to a computer science lecture, I heard quotes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>, one of the Smalltalk inventors. What he said over 20 years ago is still relevant today. That is rare in the world of computers.</li>
<li>At RailsConf 2008, Avi Bryant demonstrated <a href="http://ruby.gemstone.com/">Maglev</a> — Ruby running on the Gemstone/S Smalltalk VM. This is the future world with no relational databases. Just magic distributed object persistence.</li>
<li>When learning more about Extreme Programming, I found out that XP was invented in the Smalltalk community.</li>
<li>I keep hearing that learning Smalltalk will stretch your mind and make you a better programmer.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there are a number of reasons to get familiar with Smalltalk. Enough reasons for me to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>I installed <a href="http://www.squeak.org/Download/">Squeak</a> on my Mac since it is open source and Seaside uses it.</li>
<li>I read the article "<a href="http://users.ipa.net/%7Edwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html">Design Principles Behind Smalltalk</a>" to better understand ST's philosophy and underlying concepts. It was written in 1981 by Dan Ingalls, one of the inventors of Smalltalk. Back to the future baby!</li>
<li>I am reading a free e-book titled "<a href="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/SBE/">Squeak by Example</a>". It is a great introduction into the Smalltalk language and the Squeak environment.</li>
<li>Now that I can read Smalltalk code, I will start digging around in the Seaside source code.</li>
</ol>
<p>All right, I have to go back to my Smalltalk book now …</p>
