<p>I found myself too many times having to rewrite the last word because I hit the caps lock key by accident. I decided to take care of this annoyance once and for all</p>
<p>Here is how to turn off the caps lock key on OS X Leopard:</p>
<ol>
<li> Go to "System Preferences"</li>
<li> Select "Keyboard &amp; Mouse"</li>
<li> Go to the "Keyboard tab" and click "Modifier Keys â€¦"</li>
<li>Select "No Action" for the Caps Lock Key</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you will never be annoyed again by accidental uppercase characters. What a useless key ...</p>
