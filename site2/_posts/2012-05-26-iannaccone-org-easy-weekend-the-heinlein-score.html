<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">B</span>elow is a famous quote from the novel &ldquo;Time enough for love&rdquo;, by legendary science fiction author&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.<br />Specialization is for insects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should resonate well with all the generalists out there. The link below goes to a form where you can submit your score.</p>
