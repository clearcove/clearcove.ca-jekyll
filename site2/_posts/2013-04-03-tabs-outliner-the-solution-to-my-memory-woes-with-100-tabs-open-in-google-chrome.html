<p class="iii-article-excerpt">Combine OS X's poor memory management and Google Chrome's insatiable hunger for memory, and you will see the dreaded beach ball once you have more than a handful of tabs open in Chrome.</p>
<p class="iii-article-excerpt">Tabs Outliner is an awesome Chrome extension that lets you manage your tabs, reducing Chrome's memory footprint significantly. You can also organize your tabs into groups and save/close and re-open tabs as needed.</p>
