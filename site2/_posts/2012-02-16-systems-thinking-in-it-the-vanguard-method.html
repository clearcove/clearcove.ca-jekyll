<p>Three 15 minute videos with John Seddon, talking about the Vanguard method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Service is different to manufacturing. In simple terms, there is inherently greater variety in customer demand, hence the need to design to absorb that variety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life just isn't always consistent and predictable. When we design our apps, one of the guiding principles is to build our software in a way that maximizes the system's ability to absorb variety. This makes for apps that are still useful when a policy changes, or we now need two copy editors instead of one.</p>
