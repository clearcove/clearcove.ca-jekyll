<p>Just found this free and open software to do virtualization on OS X: <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> by Sun. It does what Parallels and VMWare Fusion do, only it's free. Macworld has a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134584/2008/07/mwvodcast59.html">5 minute video</a> showing how to install and use VMs in VirtualBox with examples for Windows XP and OpenSolaris.</p>
