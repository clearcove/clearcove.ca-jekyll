<p>Maria Popova talks about curation, ideas, cross-pollination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How we choose to pay attention, and relate to information and each other shapes who we become, shapes our creative destiny and, in turn, shapes our experience of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very inspiring presentation.</p>
