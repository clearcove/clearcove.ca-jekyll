<p>A workaround for Rails class loading issues where a namespaced module has the same name as a class:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to deal with load_missing_constant ambiguous behaviour?<br />It happens when you name your nested models like classes or modules being visible in global scope, consider User::Ticket and Ticket. Rails somehow fallbacks to ::Ticket when including User::Ticket. I bypass this by writing require_relative 'user/ticket' and include User::Ticket. I know, it is not perfect but good enough for now.</p>
