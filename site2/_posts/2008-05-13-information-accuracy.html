<p>Your information should reflect your business as closely as possible. If it doesn't, things can get really messy:</p>
<ul>
<li>information gets out of synch through various document revisions floating around in the email universe and on various users' hard drives</li>
<li>information might be out of date because a collaborator used an old document version</li>
<li>the data is not modelled accurately after your business reality</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more--></p>
