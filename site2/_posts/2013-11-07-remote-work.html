<p>At ClearCove we have been working remotely for 15 years. We have worked with clients on other continents, or in the next town. For certain kinds of jobs, this is a great model where everybody wins: The client gets access to the best talent for the job, we get to establish work/life balance and live exactly where we want to be, and the environment wins by one more person who doesn't have to commute to work every day.</p>
<p class="iii-article-source">37Signals is an example for a company that gets it. Their tools facilitate remote work through asynchronous communications, they wrote a book about it, and now they have a job board for remote jobs.</p>
