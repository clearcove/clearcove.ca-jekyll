<p>A detailed article about caching in Rails3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caching in Rails is covered occasionally. It is covered in very basic detail in the caching guide. Advanced caching is left to reader. Here&rsquo;s where I come in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page Caching: not applicable to most real world apps</li>
<li>Action Caching: a bit more useful than Page Caching, runs before_filters</li>
<li>Fragment Caching: Store parts of views</li>
<li>Rails.cache: Store anything at this level</li>
</ul>
