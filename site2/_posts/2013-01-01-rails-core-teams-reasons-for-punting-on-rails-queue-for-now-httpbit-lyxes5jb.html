<p>Rails core team decided to not include Rails.queue in the 4.0 release. @jeremy has a nice writeup for the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resque's interface is currently easier to use than Rails.queue's</li>
<li>Marshalling has some issues</li>
<li>Rails.queue is abstracting at the wrong level (equivalent to imaginary Rails.database)</li>
<li>Not efficient when working with Russian doll caching</li>
<li>There might be a better way to avoid marshalling and Job classes alltogether by processing certain jobs after the response has been sent to client. However this requires work on the Rack integration.</li>
</ul>
