<p>The longer I work with information and computers, the more I appreciate plain text format: No compatibility issues, tool doesn't get in the way, versioning via git, and documents can be shared without friction.</p>
<p>Texts Editor is a very nice editor with visual style display that outputs plain markdown formatted text.</p>
<p>Combine this with a tool like <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> (universal document converter), and you have a very powerful document pipeline.</p>
