<p>Update: Even easier than the method described below is to set your EDITOR environment variable to subl and use</p>
<pre>bundle open devise</pre>
<p>This command opens the 'devise' gem in Sublime Text 2. I use Bundler to manage gems:</p>
<pre>bundle show devise | xargs sub</pre>
<p>And as an aside, while researching the bundle open command, I also ran into</p>
<pre>bundle console</pre>
<p>which opens a Ruby IRB session with all the gems in your bundle loaded. Great if you need a console where you want your gems, but you don't want to load the Rails app.</p>
