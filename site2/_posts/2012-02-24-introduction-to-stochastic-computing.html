<p>Stochastic computing makes multiplication as simple as addition by representing numbers as probabilities. The tradeoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stochastic multiplication thus greatly reduces the size of the circuit, but also greatly increases the time required to get an accurate answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if you have lots of time, you can multiply two numbers with a single AND gate.</p>
