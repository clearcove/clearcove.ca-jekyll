<p>A great perspective, spanning several decades on what's happening with David vs. Goliath, disrupter vs.&nbsp;incumbent, free vs. monopolized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hardware, minicomputers disrupted mainframes. Then microcomputers disrupted minicomputers. Now phones and tablets are disrupting microcomputers. With each wave, a hardy band of rebels fought against everything the industry threw up in their way. Waves of salespeople spreading FUD. Rigged government procurement deals. Lobbyists in the halls of power passing laws against them. The battle cry of the Empire has always been that a victory by the rebels would cost the economy everything, that jobs would vanish and chaos would reign.&nbsp;But each victory by the rebels actually created more jobs, more wealth, and more freedom.</p>
