<p>Avdi Grimm about refactoring, referring to fairly small changes to code, taking only a few minutes each:</p>
<ul>
<li>We must be hypersensitive to pain.</li>
<li>We must have comprehensive, reliable, fast automated tests.</li>
<li>We must have a license to refactor.</li>
<li>We must have good tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also talks about a similar concept called "Refurbishing" which is at a larger scale, between a complete rewrite and refactorings.</p>
<p>Interesting to see our vocabulary for these things become more nuanced.</p>
