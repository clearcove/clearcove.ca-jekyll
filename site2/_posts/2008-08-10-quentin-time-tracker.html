<p>Being a contract software developer, tracking my time is extremely important for my business: I need to write invoices with task break downs, I want to get better at estimating, and I am just curious about what I spend my time on.</p>
<p>So I filled this need by writing my own Rails time tracker: meet Quentin. I cleaned it up a bit and just published it as an MIT-licensed <a href="http://github.com/jhund/quentin">open source project on github</a>.</p>

<p class="clear">There are a lot of time trackers available. Why did I write my own?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is mission critical data. I want full control and access. Time is my most valuable resource, so I need to understand it.</li>
<li>Track the roles I take on: SW architect, sysadmin, manager, SW developer, entrepreneur, expert, ... Quentin gives me a detailed breakdown for each role, broken down by projects and time frames. This is useful to maximize my resource utilization and to plan and measure my professional development.</li>
<li>Knowing when it is enough. When you freelance, it is easy to become restless. Quentin tells me when I have made enough money to meet my revenue targets (daily, weekly and yearly). Since I am a visual person, I had to add charts that tell me where I am at (See screenshot below)</li>
<li>Create invoices: Quentin generates invoices with detailed work break downs for my clients. No extra work required.</li>
</ul>

<p class="clear">It's easy to use: create a new task, hit enter, and the clock is ticking. Interruption? No problem. Hit stop, or just create a new task. Forget to stop the timer? Just edit the task. I have added detailed auditing so that I can measure my working hours accurately.</p>
<p>The screen shot below shows the Quentin dashboard:</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>When you track your activities every day, over the course of a year, you have a very rich pool of data to work with. With reporting, I can know how much time I spend ...</p>
<ul>
<li>on a given project - so that I can invoice my clients</li>
<li>fulfilling a certain role - so that I can plan and measure my professional development</li>
<li>per week working - so that I can work towards a sustainable work load</li>
</ul>
<p>The other things I can learn from the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>How am I doing for revenue this year?</li>
<li>Which projects are falling behind and need attention?</li>
</ul>
