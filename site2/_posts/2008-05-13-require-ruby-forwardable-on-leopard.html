<p>When I upgraded to Leopard, some of my Rails apps broke. Ruby threw this error at me:</p>
<pre>uninitialized constant User::Forwardable</pre>
<p>Here is a simple fix:</p>
<pre>
require 'forwardable'
</pre>
<p>in environment.rb.</p>
<p>It seems that on Tiger 'Forwardable' was included by default, but not on Leopard any more. Not exactly sure why this is.</p>
