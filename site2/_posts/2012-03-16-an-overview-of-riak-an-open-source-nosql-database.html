<p>Riak overview</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you should use Riak</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a reliable, extremely fast non-relational database.</li>
<li>You need private cloud storage for non-huge files which can be called directly through a browser.</li>
<li>You need a JavaScript based mapreduce engine.</li>
<li>You need to play with your database via a simple REST interface.</li>
<li>AP + Eventual consistency from CAP is OK with you.</li>
</ul>
