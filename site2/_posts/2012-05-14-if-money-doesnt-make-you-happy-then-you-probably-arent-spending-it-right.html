<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak, which may stem in part from the way people spend it. Drawing on&nbsp;empirical research, we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money. Specifically, we suggest that&nbsp;consumers should</p>
<ol>
<li>buy more experiences and fewer material goods;</li>
<li>use their money to benefit others rather than themselves;</li>
<li>buy many&nbsp;small pleasures rather than fewer large ones;</li>
<li>eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance;</li>
<li>delay consumption;</li>
<li>consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day-to-day lives;</li>
<li>beware of comparison shopping; and</li>
<li>pay close&nbsp;attention to the happiness of others.</li>
</ol>
