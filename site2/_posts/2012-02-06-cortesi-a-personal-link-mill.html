<p>@cortesi is pretty much asking forÂ <a href="http://intigi.com">Intigi</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which brings me to a rough product idea - a formalized version of this link mill for people who want to take direct control of their information intake. The business end is a generalized feed consumer, letting you subscribe to RSS feeds, Twitter users, Google+ updates, sub-Reddits and other information sources. Links are extracted from these feeds, keeping track of which links appeared where. The user is then presented with a stream of links to consume, de-duplicated so that those appearing in multiple feeds are presented only once. The system keeps track of links the user marks as "interesting", batching them for later consumption. It also uses this information to score the feeds, letting the user see which feeds are low quality, and should be ditched. Given the right tools, the time needed for a user to maintain and tend their link feed garden would be quite modest, and the rewards would be great.</p>
<p>If someone built this, I for one would gladly fork over some of my hard-earned doubloons to use it. In fact, with some validation of the idea and a few collaborators I might think of building it myself. Does this sound useful to anyone else?</p></blockquote>
