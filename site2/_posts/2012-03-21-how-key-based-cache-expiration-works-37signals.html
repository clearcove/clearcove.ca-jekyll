<p>This is how 37Signals does key-based cache expiration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The cache key is the fluid part and the cache content is the fixed part</strong>. A given key should always return the same content. You never update the content after it&rsquo;s been written and you never try to expire it either.</p>
