<blockquote>
<p>Code should be simple. Code should be butt simple. Code should be so simple that there&rsquo;s no way it can be misunderstood. Good code has no nooks. Good code has no crannies. Good code is a round room with no corners for bugs to hide&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>We all know this. So why does most code suck?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s written by people who don&rsquo;t understand the problem they&rsquo;re trying to&nbsp;solve.</p>
