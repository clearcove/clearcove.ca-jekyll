<ul>
<li>always have a subject that is relevant, i.e. when you reply make sure the subject describes what the email is about</li>
<li>put only one person in the TO: field if the email contains todo. This makes for a clear sense of responsibility</li>
<li>use plain text and don't attach images in your signature. I find it annoying when I receive emails that are marked as having an attachment, only to find out that it is the image used in the email signature. Eliminate noise!</li>
<li>put a quick summary at the top (one paragraph max). Then put all the details at the bottom of the email and don't expect the recipient to read them. It's your job as author to bring the important information to the reader's attention. It's hard work? True, that's why you do it once so your readers don't have to do it. They are at least as busy as you are.</li>
<li>Err on the side of being too friendly with your words. It's easy to misread unfriendliness into emails</li>
</ul>
