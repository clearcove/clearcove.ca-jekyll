<p>Rich Hickey talks about simple vs. easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple: not entangled with another braid. This is desirable.</li>
<li>complect: to entangle with something else. The verb that leads to complexity.</li>
<li>easy: nearby, accessible, doesn't require much work on the programmer's side. This is not desirable.</li>
<li>Example for entanglement/complexity: connascence by sequence as seen in positional method arguments (vs. keyword arguments), syntax (vs. data structures), method chaining (vs. queueing).</li>
</ul>
