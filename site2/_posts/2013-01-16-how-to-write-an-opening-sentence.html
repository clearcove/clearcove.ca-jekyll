<p>When you're stumped as to how to begin a piece of writing, consider doing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply tell the reader what the subject is.</li>
<li>Make a blunt statement.</li>
<li>Cite a statistic.</li>
<li>Tell a first-person anecdote that's relevant to the subject.</li>
<li>Tell a third-person anecdote.</li>
<li>Put up a straw man, then knock it down.</li>
<li>Summarize a current state of affairs (or the conventional wisdom), then tell what's changed.</li>
<li>Summarize previous research, then tell what new research has found.</li>
<li>Involve the reader in a bit of conjecture.</li>
<li>Start with a quotation from a famous figure. (But beware of triteness.)</li>
<li>Commit an egregious exaggeration. Then explain what the (less extreme) reality is.</li>
</ul>
<div>The article has more detail on each suggestion, and also has a list of openings not to use.</div>
