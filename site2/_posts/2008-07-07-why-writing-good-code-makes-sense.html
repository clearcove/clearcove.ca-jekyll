<p><a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/">Kent Beck</a> in his book "<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321413091">Implementation patterns</a>" explains why it makes business sense to write good code:</p>
<blockquote><p>Businesses that are able to develop and release with confidence, shift direction in response to opportunities and competition, and maintain positive morale through challenges and setbacks will tend to be more successful than businesses with shoddy, buggy code.</p></blockquote>
