<p>Here is what I had to do to enable tablet pressure support for the X11 based Gimp and Inkscape applications on OS X Leopard:</p>
<p>My setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS X Leopard: 10.5.5 on Intel</li>
<li>X11: <a href="http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/">XQuartz 2.3.2 RC2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>: 0.46 (Mac binary)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>: 2.6.3 (Mac binary)</li>
<li>Tablet: Wacom Graphire ET from around 2003</li>
</ul>
<p>Key points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>get at least the 2.3.2 version of XQuartz. 2.3.1 will not work!</li>
<li>In Gimp/Edit/Preferences/Input Devices: Click on "Configure extended input devices...", set device 'pen' to 'screen'.</li>
<li>In Inkscape/File/Input Devices ...: Set device 'pen' to 'screen'.</li>
<li>You might have to restart your apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice. Now we have pressure support on OS X for these two great apps. The Inkscape calligraphy tool is very nice. Makes my handwriting look nicer than on paper.</p>
