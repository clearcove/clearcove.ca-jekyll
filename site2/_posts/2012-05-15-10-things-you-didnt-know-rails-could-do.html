<p>James Edward Gray 2 gave a presentation about hidden skills of Rails. Here are the ones I found most interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run from a single file</li>
<li>Remind you of things via "rake notes"</li>
<li>Sandbox the console via "rails console --sandbox" (reverts all changes on exit)</li>
<li>Run helper methods in the console via "helper.number_to_currency(100)"</li>
<li>Use non-webrick servers in development via "rails s thin" (this is shorter than "bundle exec thin start"!)</li>
<li>Show you the DB's migration status via "rake db:migrate:status" to see which migrations have run.</li>
<li>Pluck fields from the DB: "User.pluck(:email)" instead of "User.select(:email).map(&amp;:email)"</li>
<li>Count DB records in groups via "Event.group(:trigger).count" =&gt; { "edit" =&gt; 3, "view" =&gt; 10 }</li>
<li>Override associations via "belongs_to :owner; def owner=(new_owner); self.previous_owner = owner; super; end"</li>
<li>Use limitless strings in PostgreSQL (via Josh Susser)</li>
<li>Use a different database for each user.</li>
<li>Merge nested hashes via Hash#deep_merge</li>
<li>Remove specific keys from a hash via "params.except(:controller, :action)"</li>
</ol>
