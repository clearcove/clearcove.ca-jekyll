<p>Martin Fowler weighs in on the test coverage debate, saying that the coverage percentage is a vanity metric. He would rather apply these criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and</li>
<li>You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
