<p>The hypothesis of the article is that you can make your writing much easier to understand by following the recommended structure, without dumbing it down or even removing technical terms.</p>
<p>It uses before/after examples to illustrate the following 7 recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow a grammatical subject as soon as possible with its verb.</li>
<li>Place in the stress position (at the end of a sentence) the "new information" you want the reader to emphasize.</li>
<li>Place the person or thing whose "story" a sentence is telling at the beginning of the sentence, in the topic position.</li>
<li>Place appropriate "old information" (material already stated in the discourse) in the topic position for linkage backward and contextualization forward.</li>
<li>Articulate the action of every clause or sentence in its verb.</li>
<li>In general, provide context for your reader before asking that reader to consider anything new.</li>
<li>In general, try to ensure that the relative emphases of the substance coincide with the relative expectations for emphasis raised by the structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>It challenged my opinions a) that I should always prefer active voice over passive voice and b) that a shorter sentence is preferrable to a longer one.</p>
<p>Applying the proposed structure to a text also helps identify logic gaps.</p>
<p>I'd say it's a must-read for anybody who conveys complex ideas with words.</p>
