<p>Servers are expensive. To save money, let's use our clients' CPUs as much as possible. The additional cost to a client is negligible (e.g., an extra 50msec), however when you multiply that by 100,000 requests (approx. 1.4 hours of server time per day), it adds up.</p>
<p>I wonder which tasks could be outsourced to the client?</p>
<ul>
<li>rendering templates (via client MVC and JSON API)</li>
<li>conversions (absolute time to relative time, time zones)</li>
<li>validations</li>
</ul>
