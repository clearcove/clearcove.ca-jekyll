<p>it's been officially released for a few days now and I think it is a big deal. OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a big step forward:</p>

<ul class="clear">
<li>Native Aqua - means it looks as beautiful as we expect from an OS X app. That has a big impact on my productivity. I enjoy working with beautiful tools. It also means that I don't need X11. Less hassle and faster startup</li>
<li>PDF import - wow, I can now edit PDFs. Very useful when I receive contracts as PDF and have to return them signed: Open contract, insert signature image, save PDF, email back. Sleek. And no need to spend a dollar on PDF editing tools.</li>
<li>Better compatibility with MS Office formats</li>
</ul>
